	<p>Need a transcription of any video or audio file under 45 minutes? Want it done within about a day's time? Well if so, you've come to just the right spot! With my services, you can have anything from a short YouTube video to a full podcast transcribed into a document of any format you'd like, for whatever purpose you wish!</p>
	<p>With any file you wish for me to transcribe (so long as it's clear enough for a listener make out), I make absolutely sure every part is rendered into text with the most diligent accuracy, and without any accidental uhm's and fillers you might want left out (though I can include them if requested)...all well within the time frame you need!</p>
	<p>I can send you the requested transcript as a Word doc, a PDF, or as virtually any other file type you desire--as well as in any format you wish. I can also, if requested, provide pagination, as well as include any cover pages, headers, or footers.</p>
	<p>If the services I offer are of any interest to you, by all means feel free to reach out--I should get back to you within the hour, and will be more than glad to promptly provide you with the transcript you wish to have.</p> <p>Thank you for your interest!</p><hr>
