	<p>Need a transcription of any video or audio file under 45 minutes? Want it done within 24 hours? Well if so, you've come to just the right spot! With my services, you can have anything from a short YouTube video to a full podcast transcribed into a document of any format you'd like, for whatever purpose you wish!
	With any file you wish for me to transcribe (so long as it's clear enough for a listener make out), I make absolutely sure every part is rendered into text with the most diligent accuracy, and without any accidental uhm's and fillers you might want left out (though I can include them if requested)...all well within the time frame you need!
	I can send you the requested transcript as a Word doc, a PDF, or as virtually any other file type you desire--as well as in any format you wish. I can also, if requested, provide pagination, as well as include any cover pages, headers, or footers.
	If the services I offer are of any interest to you, by all means feel free to reach out--I should get back to you within an hour, and will be more than glad to promptly provide you with the transcript you wish to have. Thank you for your interest!</p><br><hr>
